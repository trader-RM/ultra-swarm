 * v6.33.1 CRIT-1: Fallback map for declared coder scope by taskId.
 * When messagesTransform sets declaredCoderScope on the architect session,

 * the scope by taskId when the session's declaredCoderScope is null.
 *
 * v6.70.0 gap-closure: this map is module-scoped (not inside `swarmState`) and
 * is cleared by `resetSwarmState` via `clearPendingCoderScope()` below. Without
 * that cleanup, a `/swarm close` followed by a new session with a colliding
 * taskId (e.g. "1.1") would inherit stale scope from the previous swarm.
